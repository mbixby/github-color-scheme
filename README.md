# Github Color Scheme

Github color scheme is based around a color palette reminiscent of traditional pen and pencil note-taking. It pursuits consistent, toned-down and professional look. Comments are highlighted to match the Mac Classic.  

Github scheme is ideal for presentations or daylight programming.  

* If you get eye strain when using light themes, [FLux](http://justgetflux.com) may help

* Use with [Bluebird](https://github.com/mbixby/bluebird) for Sublime. Bluebird also includes packages for Markdown and Coffeescript with better support for Github color scheme. 
  
* In modern typography, various features are used to improve readibility of your documents. In addition to different colors, you are provided with different sizes of fonts, weights, italics, kerned-type, leading or paragraph-specific leading. In lack of software with such features, try Sublime with Monaco Lives font at 13 - 14 px (part of Bluebird).   
* Code that smells nice is code that looks nice.

* Try also the subtler [Github Notes](https://github.com/mbixby/github-notes-color-scheme) or the darker [Blackbird](https://github.com/mbixby/blackbird) & [Facebook](https://github.com/mbixby/facebook-color-scheme) combo.
